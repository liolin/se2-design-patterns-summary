* Introduction
** Most important quotes
In the introduction the basics of object-oriented programming are explained.
Therefore, for many this is easy to read.
However, some important statements are made.

#+begin_quote
Favor object composition over class inheritance
#+end_quote

Because it is very difficult to make the correct abstraction often the base class(es) are not complete or have too much in it.
With object composition you don't have this problem.

#+begin_quote
Program to an interface, not an implementation
#+end_quote
If you implement against interfaces you can test your class with unit tests.
If you implement against a fixed implementation you can not change this behavior at anytime.

** The design patterns

Class Design Patterns deal with the relationships between classes and their subclasses.
The Object Design Patterns with the object relationships which can be changed at runtime.

** The Most common causes of redesign


A list of the most common causes of redesign and how you could solve the problem.

1. Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly.

   Try to avoid creating objects explicitly otherwise you are bound to this decision.

   [[id:b73e8fc7-bbc3-4f57-8df2-5abbc96c61f6][Design Pattern - Abstract Factory]], [[id:2d54848d-995e-423c-b60b-4867b0731b68][Design Pattern - Factory Method]], [[id:f579d2af-4b38-4f6c-bd6c-538083943699][Design Pattern - Prototype]]

2. Dependence on specific operations

   Try to avoid to hard code how you want to satisfy a request.
   Example: Do not hard code how a specific button should perform.

   [[id:b24627bc-2f7c-481a-8d9e-66f35c72ed74][Design Pattern - Chain of Responsibility]], [[id:455b2078-668d-48eb-99ae-0e91afcffedf][Design Pattern - Command]]
3. Dependence on hardware and software platform

   Try to avoid implementing against a specific HW or API.

   Example: Linux & Windows does not have the same Windows System.
   Provide an abstraction in which the underlying system is not relevant.

   [[id:b73e8fc7-bbc3-4f57-8df2-5abbc96c61f6][Design Pattern - Abstract Factory]], [[id:12f6d05d-2a89-42bb-b589-7639c33f5c95][Design Pattern - Bridge]]
   
4. Dependence on object representations or implementations

   You should never bother how the inside of class works while using it.
   Otherwise, you might need to change things when the class is changing its inner live.

   [[id:71208b8f-3c01-497a-80c5-321167935dd8][Design Pattern - Builder]], [[id:4ce9446c-0cb7-4ed8-9a25-4cf9f18e0838][Design Pattern - Iterator]], [[id:72b4653d-3df2-48e0-a713-8310862decb0][Design Pattern - Strategy]], [[id:ec0aebd2-e687-4bb1-bc3c-d2b60b7692fd][Design Pattern - Template Method]], [[id:8f6c0029-51f4-4cb8-bc84-8a3c70632dfc][Design Pattern - Visitor]]

5. Algorithmic dependencies

   Do not hard code the algorithm.
   Try to encapsulate the algorithm in a class.
   Then you can replace it every time you want.

   [[id:71208b8f-3c01-497a-80c5-321167935dd8][Design Pattern - Builder]], [[id:4ce9446c-0cb7-4ed8-9a25-4cf9f18e0838][Design Pattern - Iterator]], [[id:72b4653d-3df2-48e0-a713-8310862decb0][Design Pattern - Strategy]], [[id:ec0aebd2-e687-4bb1-bc3c-d2b60b7692fd][Design Pattern - Template Method]], [[id:8f6c0029-51f4-4cb8-bc84-8a3c70632dfc][Design Pattern - Visitor]]

6. Tight coupling

   Try to avoid tight coupling.
   Otherwise, it is hard to reuse the class.

   [[id:b73e8fc7-bbc3-4f57-8df2-5abbc96c61f6][Design Pattern - Abstract Factory]], [[id:12f6d05d-2a89-42bb-b589-7639c33f5c95][Design Pattern - Bridge]], [[id:b24627bc-2f7c-481a-8d9e-66f35c72ed74][Design Pattern - Chain of Responsibility]], [[id:455b2078-668d-48eb-99ae-0e91afcffedf][Design Pattern - Command]], [[id:dfdb063d-ce56-47af-bf6a-89c7a5484464][Design Pattern - Facade]], [[id:25a72cbf-242c-48ea-b7b1-5847378c9299][Design Pattern - Mediator]], [[id:3a5552f7-02fd-4266-936e-a3a8f5300f87][Design Pattern - Observer]]
   
7. Extending functionality by subclassing

   This is very difficult to made it right.
   Instead, use object composition to extend functionality.

   [[id:12f6d05d-2a89-42bb-b589-7639c33f5c95][Design Pattern - Bridge]], [[id:b24627bc-2f7c-481a-8d9e-66f35c72ed74][Design Pattern - Chain of Responsibility]], [[id:24ad2305-b361-4021-92f3-7bfa2d87fc1e][Design Pattern - Composite]], [[id:915833c3-ba6d-4d12-9414-926aeb56b5d5][Design Pattern - Decorator]], [[id:3a5552f7-02fd-4266-936e-a3a8f5300f87][Design Pattern - Observer]], [[id:72b4653d-3df2-48e0-a713-8310862decb0][Design Pattern - Strategy]]

8. Inability to alter classes conveniently

   Sometimes you can not modify a class (for example closed source library).
   The following Design Patterns can help to work around this problem.

   [[id:919a9260-46ac-4c32-9c3c-5b164d36070c][Design Pattern - Adapter]], [[id:915833c3-ba6d-4d12-9414-926aeb56b5d5][Design Pattern - Decorator]], [[id:8f6c0029-51f4-4cb8-bc84-8a3c70632dfc][Design Pattern - Visitor]]



* Design Patterns
** Creational
*** Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.
It is a good choice, when you want to create big class hierarchy from a factory.
In general the Simple Factory ([[id:0c32236d-c1d6-439a-b87e-74380041c3af][Design Pattern - Simple Factory]]) is more common today.


Motivation:
- You want to create concrete objects without knowing which concrete type you get.
- You are only interested in the interface.


#+CAPTION: Abstract Factory Class Diagram
#+NAME: fig:abstract-factory-uml
[[file:img/abstract_factory.png]]

**** Important Notes
The Factory must be created at the very beginning of the application.
After creation only this factory must be used to create objects.
Otherwise, the benefit of the factory are gone.

*** Builder
The Builder Pattern seperates the construction of a complex class from its representation.
Therby you can hidde the creation of complex objects behind functions (see listening ref:lst:the-builder-pattern-in-action).


#+CAPTION: Builder Class Diagram
#+NAME: fig:builder-class-diagram
[[file:img/builder.png]]


#+CAPTION: The Builder Pattern in Action
#+NAME: lst:the-builder-pattern-in-action
#+begin_src c++
  Maze* MazeGame::CreateMaze () {
    Maze* aMaze = new Maze;
    Room* r1 = new Room(1);
    Room* r2 = new Room(2);
    Door* theDoor = new Door(r1, r2);
    aMaze->AddRoom(r1);
    aMaze->AddRoom(r2);
    r1->SetSide(North, new Wall);
    r1->SetSide(East, theDoor);
    r1->SetSide(South, new Wall);
    r1->SetSide(West, new Wall);
    r2->SetSide(North, new Wall);
    r2->SetSide(East, new Wall);
    r2->SetSide(South, new Wall);
    r2->SetSide(West, theDoor);
    return aMaze;
  }

  // With Builder Pattern
  Maze* MazeGame::CreateMaze (MazeBuilder& builder) {
    builder.BuildMaze();
    builder.BuildRoom(1);
    builder.BuildRoom(2);
    builder.BuildDoor(1, 2);
    return builder.GetMaze();
  }
#+end_src
*** Factory Method
The Factory Method is used to create an object, but the subclass decides which class is instantiated.
With this pattern you can create concrete creators which can decide which concrete product should be created.
The user of the creator only has to use the interface.


#+CAPTION: Factory Method Class Diagram
#+NAME: fig:factory-method-class-diagram
[[file:img/factory_method.png]]

*** Prototype
The prototype pattern is something similar like the factory method ([[id:2d54848d-995e-423c-b60b-4867b0731b68][Design Pattern - Factory Method]]) is for classes.
Using the prototype pattern you create copies from concrete objects.
This is achieved by cloning the prototype.


**** Important Notes
The crucial part of this pattern is the =Clone()= function.
During the implementation you have to decide if you want to do a deep copy or a shallow copy.

#+NAME: fig:prototype-class-diagram

#+CAPTION: Prototype Design Patter in Action
#+NAME: fig:prototype-design-patter-in-action
#+begin_src c++
  class MazePrototypeFactory : public MazeFactory {
  public:
    MazePrototypeFactory(Maze*, Wall*, Room*, Door*);
    virtual Maze* MakeMaze() const;
    virtual Room* MakeRoom(int) const;
    virtual Wall* MakeWall() const;
    virtual Door* MakeDoor(Room*, Room*) const;
  private:
    vMaze* _prototypeMaze;
    Room* _prototypeRoom;
    Wall* _prototypeWall;
    Door* _prototypeDoor;
  };

  MazePrototypeFactory::MazePrototypeFactory (Maze* m, Wall* w, Room* r, Door* d) {
    _prototypeMaze = m;
    _prototypeWall = w;
    _prototypeRoom = r;
    _prototypeDoor = d;
  }

  Maze MazePrototypeFactory::MakeMaze () {
    return this->_prototypeMaze;
  }
